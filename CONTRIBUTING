Contributions are welcome. Areas that could use some love: build & deploy on
different versions of python/docker images, and more textblob APIs supported.
Please stick to proper http/REST semantics for proposed API additions/changes.
I intend to add to these piecemeal as I need them. Open a PR if you want to add
more. Only contributions that include relevant test coverage will be accepted.
I'm not a python expert so, you know, do a good job.
